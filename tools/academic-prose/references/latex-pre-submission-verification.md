# LaTeX Pre-Submission Verification Recipes

Measured on the HOEIT-LegalQA HUJOS submission (XeLaTeX + polyglossia Vietnamese,
article class). Five reusable gates that caught real defects after all four prose
scans reported clean.

## 1. Prose-extract before paragraph-level scans on LaTeX sources

`academic_discourse_scan.py` run on raw `.tex` reports `clause_overload`
candidates that are pure markup: preamble `\usepackage` chains, `tabular` rows
(`&`-separated cells), `center` title blocks. Measured: 7 candidates, all false
positives; none was author prose.

Adjudication rule: if the quoted "sentence" contains `\usepackage`, `\begin{...}`,
`&`, or `\\` sequences, classify as markup false positive — do not "split" it.

Recipe (strip preamble, floats, tables, bibliography, then commands):

```python
import re
tex = open('main.tex', encoding='utf-8').read()
body = tex.split(r'\begin{document}',1)[1].split(r'\end{document}',1)[0]
for env in ['table','figure','tabularx','tabular','center']:
    body = re.sub(r'\\begin\{'+env+r'\}.*?\\end\{'+env+r'\}', ' ', body, flags=re.S)
body = re.sub(r'\\begin\{thebibliography\}.*?\\end\{thebibliography\}', ' ', body, flags=re.S)
body = re.sub(r'\\[a-zA-Z]+\*?(\[[^\]]*\])?(\{[^{}]*\})?', ' ', body)
body = re.sub(r'[{}$~%]', ' ', body)
body = re.sub(r'&|\\\\', '\n', body)
open('prose_only.txt','w').write(re.sub(r'[ \t]+', ' ', body))
```

Scan `prose_only.txt` for paragraph-level gates; keep sentence-level gates
(vi_ai_pattern, internal_register, process_logic) on the `.tex` directly — they
tolerate markup and must still see captions.

## 2. Bibliography heading render check (`\refname` trap)

With polyglossia Vietnamese + article class, `thebibliography` can render a
truncated/wrong heading — measured: "Tài liệu" instead of "Tài liệu tham khảo".
Source inspection shows nothing wrong; the defect only appears in the built PDF.

- Verify by `pdftotext main.pdf` and assert the full heading string appears
  immediately before `[1]`. A naive `"References" in text` check silently fails.
- Fix: `\renewcommand{\refname}{Tài liệu tham khảo}` before
  `\begin{thebibliography}` (use `\bibname` for book/report classes).

This extends the citation-bibliography integrity check in SKILL.md §6: presence
of `\bibitem`s is necessary but not sufficient — the rendered heading is part
of the gate.

## 3. Declarations placement from a published article, not from a style guess

To place Lời cảm ơn / Tài trợ / Khai báo sử dụng AI (acknowledgement / funding /
generative-AI disclosure): download one recent published article PDF from the
same journal section and read where its declarations sit relative to References.

OJS galley recipe: `…/issue/current` → collect `article/view/<id>` links →
fetch `article/view/<id>/<galleyId>` (returns the PDF). Measured HUJOS-TT:
Acknowledgement (with grant code) sits immediately before References.

Vietnamese triad that shipped (unnumbered `\section*`, after Kết luận, before
`\renewcommand{\refname}` + bibliography):

- **Lời cảm ơn** — institution that provided environment + data (name the data:
  "48 tệp PDF giáo trình luật").
- **Tài trợ** — "Nghiên cứu này được tài trợ bởi <funder>, mã số <code>."
- **Khai báo sử dụng trí tuệ nhân tạo** — what AI was used for (grammar support
  in writing, code generation), plus author-responsibility clause. Never draft
  content the authors did not confirm; ask for the exact uses and grant code.

## 4. Per-record dataset-claim verification against the released artifact

When the manuscript characterizes a released dataset ("bộ dữ liệu trắc nghiệm",
"phân bố gần đồng đều", "chia theo giáo trình nguồn"), do not trust README stats
or summary files — download every split and scan **every record**.

HF download: `https://huggingface.co/datasets/<user>/<name>/resolve/main/<path>`
with `Authorization: Bearer <token from ~/.cache/huggingface/token>` for private
datasets. Per-record invariants for an MCQ release:

1. options field is a list of exactly 4;
2. question text non-empty (find the real field name first — `question_content`,
   not `question`; a schema-key dump of one record prevents thousands of false
   alarms from a wrong field guess);
3. options distinct after strip;
4. `gold_index` in 0–3, `gold_letter == 'ABCD'[gold_index]`,
   `ground_truth == options[gold_index]`;
5. aggregate counts (splits, Bloom/label distribution, answer-position balance,
   multimodal count, distinct source docs) reconciled against every manuscript
   table they appear in.

Measured: 14,210/14,210 v1 records passed all invariants; aggregates matched the
manuscript tables exactly (Bloom 4,784/4,711/4,715; splits 9,894/2,144/2,172;
positions A–D 3,544/3,564/3,557/3,545; 48 docs; 29 multimodal). That per-record
evidence is what licenses keeping the word "trắc nghiệm" in the title/abstract.

## 5. Manuscript ↔ GitHub README ↔ HF card drift sweep

A dataset paper has three public surfaces that drift independently. Sweep all
three before submission; measured drift classes:

- **Citation blocks**: three different author lists/titles across GH bibtex,
  HF card "Citation" section, and the manuscript title block. Unify to the
  manuscript (author-confirmed) version.
- **Model version names**: README `Vintern-1B-v3` vs config/manuscript
  `Vintern-1B-v3.5`. The implementation (config.py) adjudicates.
- **Statistics methods**: README "Wilson 95% CI" vs manuscript cluster
  bootstrap; only one describes the reported numbers.
- **Version relation**: HF card says "v2 supersedes v1, do not benchmark on v1"
  while the manuscript reports v1 numbers. The card must state explicitly which
  release the paper's figures come from, or readers/reviewers see a
  contradiction.
- **Broken relative links**: markdown referencing files not in the repo
  (`research/EXECUTION_RUNBOOK.md` etc.). Test every relative path.

Standing rule (this author): prepare fixes, present the diff, **never push
without explicit approval** — on both GitHub and HF. Exception: when the author
explicitly says "cập nhật lên repo github nhé", that is the approval — commit and
push in the same turn.

## 6. pdftotext verification: normalize whitespace before substring checks

Verifying that an edit landed in the built PDF by `phrase in pdftotext_output`
produces false MISS results, because pdftotext inserts line breaks wherever the
PDF wraps — including mid-phrase. Measured: 4 of 8 checks reported MISS on a
correctly built PDF; all 8 passed after normalization. Recipe:

```python
import re
tn = re.sub(r'\s+', ' ', pdftotext_output)   # collapse all whitespace
assert "cụm từ cần kiểm tra" in tn
```

Also normalize the needle the same way (no double spaces, matching dash
characters — the source may use en dash `–` where you type hyphen `-`).

## 7. Every float must be anchored by an in-text \ref before delivery

Author rule (this user, item 3 of a 7-point structural review): "Mọi hình/bảng
nên được nhắc vào trong nội dung bài (\ref{})". A float that no sentence
references is orphaned — the reader has no entry point. Sweep at delivery time:

1. Collect every `\label{...}` inside `figure`/`table` environments.
2. Collect every `\ref{...}` in body prose.
3. Every float label must appear in at least one prose reference *before* the
   float's position (LaTeX floats can move; the reference carries the reader).
4. The referencing sentence must be substantive — "Bảng dưới đây tóm tắt kết
   quả" is `meta_prose`; "Việc cung cấp đoạn trích nguồn đúng làm tăng độ
   chính xác 8,14–20,93 đpt (Bảng~\ref{tab:acc})" is evidence anchoring.

## 8. Adding citations: Crossref-verify each, then check render order

When a review asks to strengthen claims with references ("bổ sung thêm citation ở
một số claim"), the workflow that shipped:

1. **Map claim → candidate source.** Typical gaps in an empirical dataset paper:
   a named statistical test (McNemar 1947), a resampling method (Cameron–Gelbach–
   Miller 2008 cluster bootstrap), a similarity technique (Broder 1997 shingling),
   and a documented phenomenon you observe but do not explain (LLM option-order
   bias — Pezeshkpour & Hruschka 2024; pretraining contamination — Magar &
   Schwartz 2022). Citing the method at its *definition site* and the phenomenon
   at its *observation site* is what turns "chưa xác định nguyên nhân" from a gap
   into a positioned observation.
2. **Verify every candidate through Crossref** (`api.crossref.org/works?query.bibliographic=…`,
   then re-resolve the DOI and compare author/year/title). A candidate whose DOI
   cannot be verified is dropped, not guessed — measured: "Oren 2023 test-set
   contamination" did not resolve to the intended work and was excluded while the
   other five shipped.
3. **Numbered-style (Vancouver) order check after adding entries.** In-text
   citation numbers must equal first-appearance order. Inserting `\bibitem`s at
   the end of `thebibliography` in insertion-order-of-thinking silently breaks
   this: measured, Broder (first used at line 151) was listed *after* Cameron
   (first used at line 149), which would render [19]=Broder, [20]=Cameron while
   the text cites them in the opposite order. Fix by sorting new bibitems by
   first `\cite` position in the source. Verify from the built PDF text:
   for each new ref, find its in-text phrase and the bibliography entry number
   and assert they match (`[18]` McNemar, `[19]` Cameron, `[20]` Broder,
   `[21]` Pezeshkpour, `[22]` Magar).
4. Update the width argument of `\begin{thebibliography}{NN}` when the entry
   count grows past two digits' worth of label width (17 → 22).

## 9. Renaming public artifacts (GitHub repo, HF dataset) mid-submission

When the dataset/repo gets a better name after the manuscript already links the
old one, the rename touches every surface. Measured recipe:

- **GitHub**: `gh api -X PATCH repos/<owner>/<old> -f name=<new>` renames for
  real and old URLs keep redirecting. Then sweep the repo for the old name in
  user-facing docs (README, README_COLAB, LICENSE links, bibtex `url`).
  **Distinguish URLs from provenance paths**: `/content/TQA_Pipeline/...` inside
  scripts and dataset records is the environment where the data was generated —
  rewriting it falsifies provenance and breaks defaults; leave it and say why in
  the commit message.
- **Hugging Face**: the REST API has **no dataset rename** for token auth —
  `PUT /settings {"name": ...}` returns 200 but only sets the display name, the
  repo id does not change (verify via `api/datasets/<new>` → 404). Reliable path:
  `create_repo(new, public)` → `upload_folder(staging)` → verify per-file SHA-256
  remote-vs-staged (8/8 measured) → update every reference → **ask the author
  before deleting the old repo** (irreversible; offer "delete" vs "keep with
  pointer README").
- **Branch sync after rename**: a shallow clone (`--depth`) lacks the other
  branch's refs, so `git checkout -b main origin/main` fails confusingly. Clone
  full, merge, push. Verify with the GitHub compare API (`status/ahead_by/behind_by`),
  not local `git rev-list`, whose merge-base output is meaningless on a shallow
  clone.
- **Final sweep**: grep every artifact (manuscript PDF text, GH README on *both*
  branches, HF card live via `raw/main/README.md`, source-package BUILD.md) for
  the old identifiers; only provenance-path hits may remain.

## 10. Conclusion must contain no measurement values

See SKILL.md "Conclusion progression". Mechanical gate on the built PDF:

```python
i = text.find('Kết luận'); j = text.find('Lời cảm ơn')
nums = re.findall(r'\d[\d.,]*', text[i:j])
# expect [] — the only digit runs allowed are in the footer/page number,
# which pdftotext interleaves; strip standalone page numbers before asserting.
```

Measured false positive to expect: the page number ("10") lands inside the
conclusion span because pdftotext emits footers inline. Check each numeric token
against its raw-text context before calling it a violation.
